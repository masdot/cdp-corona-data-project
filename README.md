# CDP - Corona data project
The CDP (=Corona Data Project) aims to use data analysis and evaluation to provide new insights into the spread of the Sars-CoV-II virus (coronavirus). In the same way, trends in the number of cases and deaths and in the number of vaccinations should be identified and evaluated. In this way, the effectiveness of measures to fight the coronavirus can be evaluated and possible "waves of infection" with exponential virus spread should be detected as early as possible.
